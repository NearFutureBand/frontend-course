# Test website with webpack

Created with using [this](https://dev.to/pixelgoo/how-to-configure-webpack-from-scratch-for-a-basic-website-46a5) instruction.

This website demonstrates how we could use webpack to develop websites with complex js logic. We can use any npm packages, various css preprocessors and keep it in nice comfortable project structure.

## Installation

```npm i```

## Running

To run you need to create a build:

``` npm run build ```

Then open the index.html file
